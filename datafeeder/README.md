# About

this composition provides all the necessary geOrchestra 
components to be able to use the datafeeder and import a
dataset.

# Usage

Once connected to geOrchestra (e.g. `testadmin/testadmin`),
visit [the DataFeeder UI](http://localhost:8080/import/), and fill in the wizard to upload a dataset.

A [sample zipped shapefile](./armoires.zip) is provided in
this directory, which is expected to be imported without
error.
