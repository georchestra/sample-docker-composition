# About

A simple & minimalist docker composition which aims to be able to boot
a [geOrchestra Mapstore2](https://github.com/georchestra/mapstore2-georchestra/).

As GeoSolutions also provides [its own docker images for geOrchestra](https://hub.docker.com/r/geosolutionsit/mapstore2-georchestra),
this composition can be used to check differences between official geOrchestra docker images and these ones.

# Usage

Once the composition is launched, simply open [http://localhost:8080/mapstore/](http://localhost:8080/mapstore/) in your browser.
